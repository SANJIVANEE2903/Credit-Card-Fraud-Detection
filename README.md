# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – Task 5

This is **Task 5** of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**.

## 📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised classification techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
Kaggle Dataset: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE, if used)

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning and Normalization
- EDA to understand class imbalance
- Resampling techniques (if used)
- Feature Scaling
- Model Training & Testing
- Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

## ⚖️ Imbalance Handling
Class imbalance is a major challenge in fraud detection.
Used techniques like:
- **Undersampling**
- **Oversampling / SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**

## 📈 Model Performance
Achieved high **recall and F1-score** for fraud class using models like:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
